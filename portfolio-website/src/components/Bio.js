                        I went to Missouri State University on a baseball scholarship, where I started all four years for the Bears, while also majoring in Physics/Engineering and Applied Physics. After four years of dedication and hard work, I ended up getting drafted in the 16th round of the MLB draft by the Houston Astros. During my time in the Astros minor league system, I managed to play on their A, AA, and AAA teams. 
                        When my professional baseball career ended, I went back to school to finish my Physics degree. After graduation, I had a sales opportunity that led to me moving to Denver, CO. My sales career was challenging, yet rewarding. I made top 20 reps in the company my first full year as an Account Executive, but realized something was missing in my career. I have always thought of myself as being a creative person; always having an interest in designing, developing, and improving ideas. Although I did well in my sales career, I felt like I wasn't able to develope and use my creative abilities, which led me to software development. Over the past few months I have definitely been able to flex my creative muscles while going through Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development program. Now that the program is over, my goal is to start my career with a company that will help me grow and maximumize my potential as a developer.
